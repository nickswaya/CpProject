# CpProject

The purpose of this project is to integrate and improve upon an existing project which uses Selenium to automate a significant portion of the accounts payable workflow. This project expands on that automation by integrating with the CenterViews RESTFUL interface (third-party company) to increase the reliability of the process. 

The program is tested using the older selenium script to validate calculated values as well as formatting and order of data.
